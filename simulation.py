    This is the class which is responsible for setting up and running a
    simulation. The interface is given to you: your main task is to implement
    the two methods according to their docstrings.

    Of course, you may add whatever private attributes you want to this class.
    Because you should not change the interface in any way, you may not add
    any public attributes.

    === Private Attributes ===
    _events: A sequence of events arranged in priority determined by the event
             sorting order.
